Description:
Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, <code>capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']</code>. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

# Solution
def capitalize(s):
    res1 = ''
    res2 = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            res1 = res1 + s[i].upper()
        else:
            res1 = res1 + s[i]
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i%2 != 0:
            res2 = res2 + s[i].upper()
        else:
            res2 = res2 + s[i]
    return [res1, res2]
